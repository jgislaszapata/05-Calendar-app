# 05-Calendar-app

This daily planner application allows users to set tasks for each hour of the working day and dynamically updates itself according to the time of day. 

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with additional functionality coming by way of Bootstrap, JQuery, and Moment.js. 

Upon loading the page, the user will be greeted with the planner, which contains time blocks from 9AM to 5PM. If the hour of any particular timeblock hasn't passed yet at the time of viewing the page, the timeblock will be set to a green color, indicating the timeblock is still eligiible for use. If the current hour corresponds to one of the timeblocks, the color of the block will be red, indicating so. If the current hour is past one or all of the timeblocks, the color will be set to grey, indicating the user should not plan anything in the timeblock, as the time has already passed.
